**“La Band del Bosco”** is a **musical electronic game** developed for **elderly people with senile dementia**.

It is a game for the maintenance of daily gestures, based on **music therapy** and **montessorian activities**. During the game, a musical tune is proposed and the player tries to recognize the musical instruments present in it. The game consists in placing small almond-shaped objects, with the use of a spoon, in the containers corresponding to the musical instruments the player thinks are present in the piece. The goal is to reconstruct the track one instrument at a time, in order to be able to finally hear the complete melody. Three levels of difficulty are present.  

The use of cutlery to collect small objects is a Montessori-style activity that aims to support the maintenance of the patient's independence. This aspect is particularly delicate, since, as the disease progresses, the elderly may lose the ability to carry out everyday gestures, such as eating independently. This has serious repercussions on a psychological level and that is why this game has been created: to help fight the loss of this simple but important gesture.  

Music, on the other hand, has the equally relevant purpose of entertaining, involving and promoting socialization.  

“La Band del Bosco” is a thesis project developed with the support of **Professor Andrea Bonarini** and the prototype of the game was created in collaboration with **AirLab**, Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Lab of the Politecnico di Milano.
